## Here's the scoop
Robogeddon is a 2d platform game built in python using the Arcade library. Robogeddon is set in a dystopic future where artificial intelligence has decided to eliminate humanity. This leads to a war between humans and machines. You play as Ned the cyborg. He is a black person with an afro and a mustache and can shoot lasers from his eyes. The objective is to progress through the levels without getting killed. The player wins the game when they successfully navigate through the levels and destroy the super machine on the last level.
