## Here's the scoop
Robogeddon is a 2d platform game built in python using the Arcade library. Robogeddon is set in a dystopic future where artificial intelligence has decided to eliminate humanity. This leads to a war between humans and machines. You play as Ned the cyborg. He is a black person with an afro and a mustache and can shoot lasers from his eyes. The objective is to progress through the levels without getting killed. The player wins the game when they successfully navigate through the levels and destroy the super machine on the last level.

## Features
Robogeddon features the PyMunk physics engine for more realistic physics simulations such as collision, mass, and friction responses. I used the arcade library due to its modern and pythonic nature. Robogeddon is a demonstration of what I have learned in in the python courses at CodingNomads and I focused primarily on the object oriented programming (oop) paradigm as it is the focus of python 301 (course with the capstone assignment). 

## Usage
To run this game, make sure python is installed on your machine. Download and install python at python.org. Next, clone the repository: https://github.com/C0ZYCHAIRM4N/Kyle_Capstone_Project.git. Navigate to the project directory: cd Kyle_Capstone_Project. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies. To play the game run the main script: python main.py.
